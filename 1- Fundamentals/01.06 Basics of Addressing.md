## IP Address

- It's called **logical address** as it **can be changed due to the location or logic**.

## MAC Address

- Stands for **Media Access Control**.
- **IP Address -> Location of a person .. MAC Address -> Name of a person**.

Note how the Routers work by **Checking the transport layer then check the network layer** and if it finds in the transport layer that this data is not for this router **note how it changes the physical addresses** and forward the data.
