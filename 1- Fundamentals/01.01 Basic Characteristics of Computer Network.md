A computer network is a set of **nodes** connected by **communication links**

In the computer networks there's an end devices and intermediate devices the end devices is the devices the communication starts from or ends at them.

Basic Characteristics of Computer Network are fault tolerance, scalable, (QOS) and the security.

**Fault Tolerance**: Is the ability of the computer network to continue working despite failures and ensure no loss of service.

**Quality of Service**: Is the ability to set priorities (serve which request first) and manage data traffic to reduce data loss and delay.
