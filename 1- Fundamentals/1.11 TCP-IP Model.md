You can think of the **PDU** this way:  

 "when data travels across the network, it **changes its form** at each layer — each layer adds or removes some information (called **headers** or **trailers**) depending on what that layer needs to do"

That “version” of the data — with its headers and content — is called the **PDU** for that layer.
