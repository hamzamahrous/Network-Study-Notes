The Layered architectures are **OSI Reference Model** and **TCP/IP Model**.

## OSI Model

- Stands for **Open Source Interconnection**.
- It's not a protocol it's only a guideline.
- The purpose of the OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software.

## TCP/IP

- **TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**.
- It's a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality.
