## Data Flow

- **Simplex**: one side can send the data and the other receive.
- **Half Duplex**: communication is in both directions but not at the same time.
- **Duplex**: communication is in both directions simultaneously.

## Protocols

- Protocol is a set of rules that govern data communication.
- Protocols used in network define .. **message encoding** .. **message formatting and encapsulation** .. **message timing and size** .. and the **message delivery options**.  

**Message Encoding**
![Pasted image 20250927170842](Pasted%20Images/Pasted%20image%2020250927170842.png)

**message formatting and encapsulation** .. means that we agreed on some formatting and encapsulate some information like the sender and the receiver info (IP Address).

**message timing** is about that the protocol should handle the **flow control** and the **response timeout** that means that when for example the sender is fast and the receiver is slow then the sender must wait for the **acknowledgment** so the protocol is the one that determines how much time.

**message delivery options** .. have three types ... **Unicast** -> one sender and one receiver ... **Multicast** -> sending to some receivers but not all of them ... and **Broadcasting** -> Sending to all of them.

## Peer-to-Peer vs Client-server Networks

- **Peer-to-Peer** means that there's no centralized administration and all peers are equal and this is used for simple sharing applications and it's not scalable.

- **Client Server** there will be centralized administration, it will follow the **request-response** model, scalable and the server may be overloaded.
