Every IP address will have a **Subnet Mask** this subnet mask determines who are our neighbors in the network.

If you used the command **ipconfig** it will gives you the information about the network layer for getting the mac address information use **ipconfig/all**

The **DNS(Domain Name Server)** is used to get the IP address of some server by giving just the name ... to get this information you can use the command **nslookup**.

You can use the command **ping** then write the IP address or the server name like `www.facebook.com` to check if you can connect to this server.

To track how some packet is transferred from your computer to another computer you can use the command **tracert** and you will see the intermediate routers.
