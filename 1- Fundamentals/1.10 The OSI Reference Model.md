This is how two different devices can share data using OSI Model ... note that for the sender the data will be handled from up to down until it reach the physical layer then the data is transmitted ... and for the receiver the data will be handled from bottom to up.
***
The **Application Layer** is concerned with enabling the user to access the network resources.

The **Presentation Layer** is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between the systems .. it provides the following services:
- Translation
- Encryption
- Compression .. for multi-media data.

The **Session Layer** is concerned with establishing, maintaining and synchronizing the interaction among communicating devices .. it provides the following services:
- Dialog control
- Synchronization
***
The **Transport Layer** is responsible for process to process delivery of the entire message .. it provides the following services:
- **Port addressing services**.
- Segmentations and Reassembly -> If the message is big then it's responsible for dividing it at the sender then reassembling it at the receiver.
- Connection control -> switching control.
- End-to-End flow control -> e.g. agree on a specific speed.
- Error control.
***
The **Network Layer** is responsible for delivery of the data from the original source to the destination network ..  it provides the following services:
- Logical addressing -> **IP addressing services**.
- Routing -> Finding the best route for sending the data.
***
The **Data Link Layer** is responsible for moving data from one node to another node .. it provides the following services:
- Framing -> Groups the bits of zeros and ones.
- Physical addressing -> **MAC addressing services**.
- Flow control 
- Error control 
- Access control -> Determine which device has control of the link at this time (if it's a common link).
***
The **Physical Layer** is responsible for transmitting bits over a medium .. it provides the following services:
- Physical characteristics of the media
- Data rate
- Line configuration (1-1 or 1-many) .. and more services.
