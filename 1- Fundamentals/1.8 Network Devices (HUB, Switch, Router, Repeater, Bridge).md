Note that there's also .. multi-layer switch, brouter, modem, firewall (security device) .. but we won't go deep in them.
## HUB

- Hub used to set up LAN as it has multiple ports.
- It works at the physical layer **(Layer 1 device)**.
- It works as **star topology**.
- When a packet arrives at one port, it's copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all packets.
- Hubs has **no memory**.
- Normally works in **half duplex** mode.

## Switches

- **Layer 2 device** for setting up LAN.
- It **has memory** so it uses the memory to store **MAC ADDRESS TABLE** .. so it will forward the data to only the required device.
- It also can do multicasting or broadcasting.
- **Full duplex** device.
- In the first time communication the switch do broadcasting ... after that it will do unicasting as it will be learned the MAC addresses.
## Router

- Forward data packets between computer networks ... so at least it's connected to two networks, commonly two LANs or WANs, or LAN and it's ISP's network.
- **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** device.
- **Stores routing table**.

- The router has interfaces for each connected network ... each interface has an IP .. the interface must be a part of the network it's connected to and it will be the default gateway for all devices in this network.

**Switches vs Routers**

## Repeater

- The data signals generally become too weak or corrupted if they tend travel a long distance .. so here come's the repeater as it regenerates the signal **over the same network**.
- **Layer 1** device.
- They **don't amplify** the signal it just regenerate it.

## Bridge

- Bridge = Repeater + Functionality of reading MAC address (**Layer 2 device**).
- It's used for interconnecting two LANS **on the same protocol**.

First type is the **transparent bridges** .. in this type the stations will be unaware of the bridge's existence .. that means that you don't need to reconfigure the stations if the bridge is added or removed.

Second type is **source routing** .. in this type the routing operation is performed by the source station and the frame specifies which route to follow ... so each source station will be the one to decide the routing options.
